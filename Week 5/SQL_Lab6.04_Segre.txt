FROM sakila.customer AS c
JOIN sakila.rental AS r
USING (customer_id)
JOIN sakila.inventory as i
USING (inventory_id)
JOIN sakila.film_category as f_c
USING (film_id)
JOIN sakila.category as cat
USING (category_id)
WHERE cat.name = 'Action'

ORDER BY customer_id;
b.Write the query using sub queries with multiple WHERE clause and IN condition
b.
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS name, email
FROM sakila.customer
WHERE customer_id IN
	(SELECT customer_id 
	FROM sakila.rental
	WHERE inventory_id IN
		(SELECT inventory_id
		from sakila.inventory AS i
		WHERE i.film_id IN
			(SELECT f_c.film_id
			FROM sakila.film_category as f_c
			JOIN sakila.category as cat
			USING (category_id)
			WHERE cat.name = 'Action')))
ORDER BY customer_id;

c.Verify if the above two queries produce the same results or not
c.
Same

4. Use the case statement to create a new column classifying existing columns as either or high value transactions based on the amount of payment. If the amount is between 0 and 2, label should be low and if the amount is between 2 and 4, the label should be medium, and if it is more than 4, then it should be high
