1.List each pair of actors that have worked together.
USE sakila;
SELECT * FROM sakila.actor act
JOIN sakila.film_actor fact
ON act.actor_id <> fact.actor_id 
AND act.film_id = fact.film_id 

SELECT act.film_id, CONCAT (ac1.first_name, ' ',ac1.last_name), concat(ac2.first_name, ' ',ac2.last_name)
FROM sakila.actor ac1
INNER JOIN film_Actor act ON ac1.actor_id = ac2.actor_id
INNER JOIN film_actor fact ON (act.film_id = fact.film_id) AND (act.actor_id <> fact.actor_id)
INNER JOIN actor ac1 ON ac2.actor_id= fact2.actor_id;

INNER JOIN sakila.actor ac2

2.For each film, list actor that has acted in more films.
select f.title, concat(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) as best_actor
from (
  select film_id, actor_id, rank() over (
    partition by film_id
    order by num_films
    desc
  ) as m
from film_actor
inner join actor_movies
using (actor_id)) t
inner join actor a on t.actor_id = a.actor_id
inner join film f on t.film_id = f.film_id
where m = 1;
