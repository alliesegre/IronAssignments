Just make a prediction on the category

1.Create a query or queries to extract the information you think may be relevant for building the prediction model. It should include some film features and some rental features.

2.Read the data into a Pandas dataframe.

3.Analyze extracted features and transform them. You may need to encode some categorical variables, or scale numerical variables.

4.Create a query to get the list of films and a boolean indicating if it was rented last month. This would be our target variable.

5.Create a logistic regression model to predict this variable from the cleaned data.

6.Evaluate the results.
